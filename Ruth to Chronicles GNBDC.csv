RUT,1,1-2,"Long ago, in the days before Israel had a king, there was a famine in the land. So a man named Elimelech, who belonged to the clan of Ephrath and who lived in Bethlehem in Judah, went with his wife Naomi and their two sons Mahlon and Chilion to live for a while in the country of Moab. While they were living there,",GNBDC
RUT,1,3,"Elimelech died, and Naomi was left alone with her two sons,",GNBDC
RUT,1,4,"who married Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. About ten years later",GNBDC
RUT,1,5,"Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left all alone, without husband or sons.",GNBDC
RUT,1,6,Some time later Naomi heard that the,GNBDC

RUT,1,8,"she said to them, “Go back home and stay with your mothers. May the",GNBDC
RUT,1,9,And may the,GNBDC
RUT,1,?,So Naomi kissed them goodbye. But they started crying,GNBDC
RUT,1,10,"and said to her, “No! We will go with you to your people.”",GNBDC
RUT,1,11,"“You must go back, my daughters,” Naomi answered. “Why do you want to come with me? Do you think I could have sons again for you to marry?",GNBDC
RUT,1,12,"Go back home, for I am too old to get married again. Even if I thought there was still hope, and so got married tonight and had sons,",GNBDC
RUT,1,13,"would you wait until they had grown up? Would this keep you from marrying someone else? No, my daughters, you know that's impossible. The",GNBDC
RUT,1,14,"Again they started crying. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye and went back home,",GNBDC
RUT,1,15,"So Naomi said to her, “Ruth, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god.",GNBDC
RUT,1,16,"But Ruth answered, “Don't ask me to leave you! Let me go with you. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.",GNBDC
RUT,1,17,"Wherever you die, I will die, and that is where I will be buried. May the",GNBDC
RUT,1,18,"When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.",GNBDC
RUT,1,19,"They went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town got excited, and the women there exclaimed, “Is this really Naomi?”",GNBDC
RUT,1,20,"“Don't call me Naomi,” she answered; “call me Marah,",GNBDC
RUT,1,21,"When I left here, I had plenty, but the",GNBDC
RUT,1,22,"This, then, was how Naomi came back from Moab with Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law. The barley harvest was just beginning when they arrived in Bethlehem.",GNBDC
RUT,2,1,"Naomi had a relative named Boaz, a rich and influential man who belonged to the family of her husband Elimelech.",GNBDC
RUT,2,2,"One day Ruth said to Naomi, “Let me go to the fields to gather the corn that the harvest workers leave. I am sure to find someone who will let me work with him.”",GNBDC
RUT,2,?,"Naomi answered, “Go ahead, my daughter.”",GNBDC
RUT,2,3,"So Ruth went out to the fields and walked behind the workers, picking up the corn which they left. It so happened that she was in a field that belonged to Boaz.",GNBDC
RUT,2,4,Some time later Boaz himself arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the workers. “The,GNBDC
RUT,2,?,“The,GNBDC
RUT,2,5,"Boaz asked the man in charge, “Who is that young woman?”",GNBDC
RUT,2,6,"The man answered, “She is the young woman from Moab who came back with Naomi.",GNBDC
RUT,2,7,She asked me to let her follow the workers and pick up the corn. She has been working since early morning and has just now stopped to rest for a while under the shelter.”,GNBDC
RUT,2,8,"Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Let me give you some advice. Don't pick up corn anywhere except in this field. Work with the women here;",GNBDC
RUT,2,9,"watch them to see where they are reaping and stay with them. I have ordered my men not to molest you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and drink from the water jars that they have filled.”",GNBDC
RUT,2,10,"Ruth bowed down with her face touching the ground, and said to Boaz, “Why should you be so concerned about me? Why should you be so kind to a foreigner?”",GNBDC
RUT,2,11,"Boaz answered, “I have heard about everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. I know how you left your father and mother and your own country and how you came to live among a people you had never known before.",GNBDC
RUT,2,12,May the,GNBDC
RUT,2,13,"Ruth answered, “You are very kind",GNBDC
RUT,2,14,"At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, “Come and have a piece of bread, and dip it in the sauce.” So she sat with the workers, and Boaz passed some roasted grain to her. She ate until she was satisfied, and she still had some food left over.",GNBDC
RUT,2,15-16,"After she had left to go on picking up corn, Boaz ordered the workers, “Let her pick it up even where the bundles are lying, and don't say anything to stop her. Besides that, pull out some corn from the bundles and leave it for her to pick up.”",GNBDC
RUT,2,17,"So Ruth went on gathering corn in the field until evening, and when she had beaten it out, she found she had nearly ten kilogrammes.",GNBDC
RUT,2,18,She took the corn back into town and showed her mother-in-law how much she had gathered. She also gave her the food left over from the meal.,GNBDC
RUT,2,19,"Naomi asked her, “Where did you gather all this? Whose field have you been working in? May God bless the man who took an interest in you!”",GNBDC
RUT,2,?,So Ruth told Naomi that she had been working in a field belonging to a man named Boaz.,GNBDC
RUT,2,21,"Then Ruth said, “Best of all, he told me to keep picking up corn with his workers until they finish the harvest.”",GNBDC
RUT,2,22,"Naomi said to Ruth, “Yes, my daughter, it will be better for you to work with the women in Boaz' field. You might be molested if you went to someone else's field.”",GNBDC
RUT,2,23,So Ruth worked with them and gathered corn until all the barley and wheat had been harvested. And she continued to live with her mother-in-law.,GNBDC
RUT,3,1,"Some time later Naomi said to Ruth, “I must find a husband for you, so that you will have a home of your own.",GNBDC
RUT,3,2,"Remember that this man Boaz, whose women you have been working with, is our relative. Now listen. This evening he will be threshing the barley.",GNBDC
RUT,3,3,"So wash yourself, put on some perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go where he is threshing, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking.",GNBDC
RUT,3,4,"Be sure to notice where he lies down, and after he falls asleep, go and lift the covers and lie down at his feet. He will tell you what to do.”",GNBDC
RUT,3,5,"Ruth answered, “I will do everything you say.”",GNBDC
RUT,3,6,So Ruth went to the threshing place and did just what her mother-in-law had told her.,GNBDC
RUT,3,7,"When Boaz had finished eating and drinking, he was in a good mood. He went to the pile of barley and lay down to sleep. Ruth slipped over quietly, lifted the covers and lay down at his feet.",GNBDC
RUT,3,8,"During the night he woke up suddenly, turned over, and was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet.",GNBDC
RUT,3,9,“Who are you?” he asked.,GNBDC
RUT,3,?,"“It's Ruth, sir,” she answered. “Because you are a close relative, you are responsible for taking care of me. So please marry me.”",GNBDC
RUT,3,10,“The,GNBDC
RUT,3,11,"Now don't worry, Ruth. I will do everything you ask; as everyone in town knows, you are a fine woman.",GNBDC
RUT,3,12,"It is true that I am a close relative and am responsible for you, but there is a man who is a closer relative than I am.",GNBDC
RUT,3,13,"Stay here the rest of the night, and in the morning we will find out whether or not he will take responsibility for you. If so, well and good; if not, then I swear by the living",GNBDC
RUT,3,14,"So she lay there at his feet, but she got up before it was light enough for her to be seen, because Boaz did not want anyone to know that she had been there.",GNBDC
RUT,3,15,"Boaz said to her, “Take off your cloak and spread it out here.” She did, and he poured out nearly twenty kilogrammes of barley and helped her to lift it on her shoulder. Then she returned to the town with it.",GNBDC
RUT,3,16,"When she arrived home, her mother-in-law asked her, “How did you get on, my daughter?”",GNBDC
RUT,3,?,Ruth told her everything that Boaz had done for her.,GNBDC
RUT,3,17,"She added, “He told me I must not come back to you empty-handed, so he gave me all this barley.”",GNBDC
RUT,3,18,"Naomi said to her, “Now be patient, Ruth, until you see how this all turns out. Boaz will not rest today until he settles the matter.”",GNBDC
RUT,4,1,"Boaz went to the meeting place at the town gate and sat down there. Then Elimelech's nearest relative, the man whom Boaz had mentioned, came by, and Boaz called to him, “Come over here, my friend, and sit down.” So he went over and sat down.",GNBDC
RUT,4,2,"Then Boaz got ten of the leaders of the town and asked them to sit down there too. When they were seated,",GNBDC
RUT,4,3,"he said to his relative, “Now that Naomi has come back from Moab, she wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech,",GNBDC
RUT,4,4,"and I think you ought to know about it. Now then, if you want it, buy it in the presence of these men sitting here. But if you don't want it, say so, because the right to buy it belongs first to you and then to me.”",GNBDC
RUT,4,?,"The man said, “I will buy it.”",GNBDC
RUT,4,5,"Boaz said, “Very well, but if you buy the field from Naomi, then you are also buying Ruth,",GNBDC
RUT,4,6,"The man answered, “In that case I will give up my right to buy the field, because it would mean that my own children would not inherit it. You buy it; I would rather not.”",GNBDC
RUT,4,8,"So when the man said to Boaz, “You buy it,” he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz.",GNBDC
RUT,4,9,"Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the others there, “You are all witnesses today that I have bought from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech and to his sons Chilion and Mahlon.",GNBDC
RUT,4,10,"In addition, Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon's widow, becomes my wife. This will keep the property in the dead man's family, and his family line will continue among his people and in his town. You are witnesses to this today.”",GNBDC
RUT,4,12,May the children that the,GNBDC
RUT,4,13,So Boaz took Ruth home as his wife. The,GNBDC
RUT,4,14,"The women said to Naomi, “Praise the",GNBDC
RUT,4,15,"Your daughter-in-law loves you, and has done more for you than seven sons. And now she has given you a grandson, who will bring new life to you and give you security in your old age.”",GNBDC
RUT,4,16,"Naomi took the child, held him close,",GNBDC
RUT,4,17,"The women of the neighbourhood named the boy Obed. They told everyone, “A son has been born to Naomi!”",GNBDC
RUT,4,?,"Obed became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.",GNBDC
RUT,4,18-22,"This is the family line from Perez to David: Perez, Hezron, Ram, Amminadab, Nahshon, Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David.",GNBDC
1SA,1,1,"There was a man named Elkanah, from the tribe of Ephraim, who lived in the town of Ramah in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham and grandson of Elihu, and belonged to the family of Tohu, a part of the clan of Zuph.",GNBDC

1SA,1,3,Every year Elkanah went from Ramah to worship and offer sacrifices to the,GNBDC

1SA,1,13,"She was praying silently; her lips were moving, but she made no sound. So Eli thought that she was drunk,",GNBDC
1SA,1,14,"and said to her, “Stop making a drunken show of yourself! Stop your drinking and sober up!”",GNBDC
1SA,1,15,"“No, I'm not drunk, sir,” she answered. “I haven't been drinking! I am desperate, and I have been praying, pouring out my troubles to the",GNBDC

1SA,1,18,"“May you always think kindly of me,” she replied. Then she went away, ate some food, and was no longer sad.",GNBDC

1SA,2,12,The sons of Eli were scoundrels. They paid no attention to the,GNBDC
1SA,2,13,"or to the regulations concerning what the priests could demand from the people. Instead, when anyone was offering a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork. While the meat was still cooking,",GNBDC
1SA,2,14,"he would stick the fork into the cooking pot, and whatever the fork brought out belonged to the priest. All the Israelites who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices were treated like this.",GNBDC

1SA,8,2,The elder son was named Joel and the younger one Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba.,GNBDC
1SA,8,3,"But they did not follow their father's example; they were interested only in making money, so they accepted bribes and did not decide cases honestly.",GNBDC
1SA,8,4,"Then all the leaders of Israel met together, went to Samuel in Ramah,",GNBDC
1SA,8,5,"and said to him, “Look, you are getting old and your sons don't follow your example. So then, appoint a king to rule over us, so that we will have a king, as other countries have.”",GNBDC

1SA,8,10,Samuel told the people who were asking him for a king everything that the,GNBDC

1SA,8,12,"He will make some of them officers in charge of a thousand men, and others in charge of fifty men. Your sons will have to plough his fields, harvest his crops, and make his weapons and the equipment for his chariots.",GNBDC
1SA,8,13,Your daughters will have to make perfumes for him and work as his cooks and his bakers.,GNBDC
1SA,8,14,"He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials.",GNBDC
1SA,8,15,He will take a tenth of your corn and of your grapes for his court officers and other officials.,GNBDC
1SA,8,16,He will take your servants and your best cattle,GNBDC

1SA,8,18,"When that time comes, you will complain bitterly because of your king, whom you yourselves chose, but the",GNBDC
1SA,8,19,"The people paid no attention to Samuel, but said “No! We want a king,",GNBDC
1SA,8,20,"so that we will be like other nations, with our own king to rule us and to lead us out to war and to fight our battles.”",GNBDC
1SA,8,21,Samuel listened to everything they said and then went and told the,GNBDC
1SA,8,22,The,GNBDC
1SA,9,1,"There was a wealthy and influential man named Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin; he was the son of Abiel and grandson of Zeror, and belonged to the family of Becorath, a part of the clan of Aphiah.",GNBDC
1SA,9,2,"He had a son named Saul, a handsome man in the prime of life. Saul was a head taller than anyone else in Israel and more handsome as well.",GNBDC
1SA,9,3,"Some donkeys belonging to Kish had wandered off, so he said to Saul, “Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,4,"They went through the hill country of Ephraim and the region of Shalishah, but did not find them; so they went on through the region of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then they went through the territory of Benjamin, but still did not find them.",GNBDC
1SA,9,5,"When they came into the region of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, “Let's go back home, or my father might stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,6,"The servant answered, “Wait! In this town there is a holy man who is highly respected because everything he says comes true. Let's go to him, and maybe he can tell us where we can find the donkeys.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,7,"“If we go to him, what can we give him?” Saul asked. “There is no food left in our packs, and we haven't anything to give him, have we?”",GNBDC
1SA,9,8,"The servant answered, “I have a small silver coin. I can give him that, and then he will tell us where we can find them.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,9-11,"Saul replied, “A good idea! Let's go.” So they went to the town where the holy man lived. As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women who were coming out to draw water. They asked these women, “Is the seer in town?”",GNBDC
1SA,9,?,"(At that time a prophet was called a seer, and so whenever someone wanted to ask God a question, he would say, “Let's go to the seer.”)",GNBDC
1SA,9,12-13,"“Yes, he is,” the young women answered. “In fact, he is just ahead of you. If you hurry, you will catch up with him. As soon as you go into the town, you will find him. He arrived in town today because the people are going to offer a sacrifice on the altar on the hill. The people who are invited won't start eating until he gets there, because he has to bless the sacrifice first. If you go now, you will find him before he goes up the hill to eat.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,14,"So Saul and his servant went on to the town, and as they were going in, they saw Samuel coming out towards them on his way to the place of worship.",GNBDC
1SA,9,15,Now on the previous day the,GNBDC
1SA,9,16,"“Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the tribe of Benjamin; anoint him as ruler of my people Israel, and he will rescue them from the Philistines. I have seen the suffering of my people and have heard their cries for help.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,17,"When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the",GNBDC
1SA,9,18,"Then Saul went over to Samuel, who was near the gate, and asked, “Tell me, where does the seer live?”",GNBDC
1SA,9,19,"Samuel answered, “I am the seer. Go on ahead of me to the place of worship. Both of you are to eat with me today. Tomorrow morning I will answer all your questions and send you on your way.",GNBDC
1SA,9,20,"As for the donkeys that were lost three days ago, don't worry about them; they have already been found. But who is it that the people of Israel want so much?",GNBDC
1SA,9,21,"Saul answered, “I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important one in the tribe. Why, then, do you talk like this to me?”",GNBDC
1SA,9,22,"Then Samuel led Saul and his servant into the large room and gave them a place at the head of the table where the guests, about thirty in all, were seated.",GNBDC
1SA,9,23,"Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the piece of meat I gave you, which I told you to set aside.”",GNBDC
1SA,9,24,So the cook brought the choice piece of the leg and placed it before Saul. Samuel,GNBDC
1SA,9,?,So Saul ate with Samuel that day.,GNBDC
1SA,9,25,"When they went down from the place of worship to the town, they made up a bed for Saul",GNBDC
1SA,9,26,and he slept there.,GNBDC
1SA,9,?,"At dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, “Get up, and I will send you on your way.” Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out to the street together.",GNBDC
1SA,9,27,"When they arrived at the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us.” The servant left, and Samuel continued, “Stay here a minute, and I will tell you what God has said.”",GNBDC
1SA,10,1,"Then Samuel took a jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head, kissed him, and said, “The",GNBDC
1SA,10,2,"when you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They will tell you that the donkeys you were looking for have been found, so that your father isn't worried any more about them but about you, and he keeps asking, ‘What shall I do about my son?’",GNBDC
1SA,10,3,"You will go on from there until you come to the sacred tree at Tabor, where you will meet three men on their way to offer a sacrifice to God at Bethel. One of them will be leading three young goats, another one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and the third one will have a leather bag full of wine.",GNBDC
1SA,10,4,"They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves, which you are to accept.",GNBDC
1SA,10,5,"Then you will go to the Hill of God in Gibeah, where there is a Philistine camp. At the entrance to the town you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the altar on the hill, playing harps, drums, flutes, and lyres. They will be dancing and shouting.",GNBDC
1SA,10,6,Suddenly the Spirit of the,GNBDC
1SA,10,7,"When these things happen, do whatever God leads you to do.",GNBDC
1SA,10,8,"You will go ahead of me to Gilgal, where I will meet you and offer burnt sacrifices and fellowship sacrifices. Wait there seven days until I come and tell you what to do.”",GNBDC
1SA,10,9,"When Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave Saul a new nature. And everything Samuel had told him happened that day.",GNBDC
1SA,10,10,"When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Suddenly the Spirit of God took control of him, and he joined in their ecstatic dancing and shouting.",GNBDC
1SA,10,11,"People who had known him before saw him doing this and asked one another, “What has happened to the son of Kish? Has Saul become a prophet?”",GNBDC
1SA,10,12,"A man who lived there asked, “How about these other prophets — who do you think their fathers are?” This is how the saying originated, “Has even Saul become a prophet?”",GNBDC
1SA,10,13,"When Saul finished his ecstatic dancing and shouting, he went to the altar on the hill.",GNBDC
1SA,10,14,"Saul's uncle saw him and the servant, and he asked them, “Where have you been?”",GNBDC
1SA,10,?,"“Looking for the donkeys,” Saul answered. “When we couldn't find them, we went to see Samuel.”",GNBDC
1SA,10,15,“And what did he tell you?” Saul's uncle asked.,GNBDC
1SA,10,16,"“He told us that the animals had been found,” Saul answered — but he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about his becoming king.",GNBDC
1SA,10,17,Samuel called the people together for a religious gathering at Mizpah,GNBDC
1SA,10,18,"and said to them, “The",GNBDC

1SA,10,22,they asked the,GNBDC

1SA,10,23,"So they ran and brought Saul out to the people, and they could see that he was a head taller than anyone else.",GNBDC
1SA,10,24,"Samuel said to the people, “Here is the man the",GNBDC
1SA,10,?,"All the people shouted, “Long live the king!”",GNBDC
1SA,10,25,"Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of a king, and then wrote them in a book, which he deposited in a holy place. Then he sent everyone home.",GNBDC
1SA,10,26,"Saul also went back home to Gibeah. Some powerful men,",GNBDC
1SA,10,27,"But some worthless people said, “How can this fellow do us any good?” They despised Saul and did not bring him any gifts.",GNBDC
1SA,11,1,"About a month later King Nahash of Ammon led his army against the town of Jabesh in the territory of Gilead and besieged it. The men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty with us, and we will accept you as our ruler.”",GNBDC

1SA,11,6,"When Saul heard this, the Spirit of God took control of him, and he became furious.",GNBDC
1SA,11,7,"He took two oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent messengers to carry the pieces throughout the land of Israel with this warning: “Whoever does not follow Saul and Samuel into battle will have this done to his oxen!”",GNBDC

1SA,11,11,"That night Saul divided his men into three groups, and at dawn they rushed into the enemy camp and attacked the Ammonites. By noon they had slaughtered them. The survivors scattered, each man running off by himself.",GNBDC
1SA,11,12,"Then the people of Israel said to Samuel, “Where are the people who said that Saul should not be our king? Hand them over to us, and we will kill them!”",GNBDC
1SA,11,13,"But Saul said, “No one will be put to death today, for this is the day the",GNBDC

1SA,19,14,"When Saul's men came to get David, Michal told them that he was ill.",GNBDC
1SA,19,15,"But Saul sent them back to see David for themselves. He ordered them, “Carry him here in his bed, and I will kill him.”",GNBDC
1SA,19,16,They went inside and found the household idol in the bed and the goats'-hair pillow at its head.,GNBDC
1SA,19,17,"Saul asked Michal, “Why have you tricked me like this and let my enemy escape?”",GNBDC
1SA,19,?,"She answered, “He said he would kill me if I didn't help him to escape.”",GNBDC
1SA,19,18,David escaped and went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there.,GNBDC
1SA,19,19,"Saul was told that David was in Naioth in Ramah,",GNBDC
1SA,19,20,so he sent some men to arrest him. They saw,GNBDC
1SA,19,21,"When Saul heard of this, he sent more messengers, and they also began to dance and shout. He sent messengers the third time, and the same thing happened to them.",GNBDC
1SA,19,22,"Then he himself started out for Ramah. When he came to the large well in Secu, he asked where Samuel and David were and was told that they were at Naioth.",GNBDC
1SA,19,23,"As he was going there, the Spirit of God took control of him also, and he danced and shouted all the way to Naioth.",GNBDC
1SA,19,24,"He took off his clothes and danced and shouted in Samuel's presence, and lay naked all that day and all that night. (This is how the saying originated, “Has even Saul become a prophet?”)",GNBDC
1SA,20,1,Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and went to Jonathan. “What have I done?” he asked. “What crime have I committed? What wrong have I done to your father to make him want to kill me?”,GNBDC
1SA,20,2,"Jonathan answered, “God forbid that you should die! My father tells me everything he does, important or not, and he would not hide this from me. It isn't true!”",GNBDC
1SA,20,3,"But David answered,",GNBDC
1SA,20,4,"Jonathan said, “I'll do anything you want.”",GNBDC
1SA,20,6,"If your father notices that I am not at table, tell him that I begged your permission to hurry home to Bethlehem, since it's the time for the annual sacrifice there for my whole family.",GNBDC
1SA,20,7,"If he says, ‘All right,’ I will be safe; but if he becomes angry, you will know that he is determined to harm me.",GNBDC
1SA,20,8,"Please do me this favour, and keep the sacred promise you made to me. But if I'm guilty, kill me yourself! Why take me to your father to be killed?”",GNBDC
1SA,20,9,"“Don't even think such a thing!” Jonathan answered. “If I knew for certain that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?”",GNBDC
1SA,20,10,"David then asked, “Who will let me know if your father answers you angrily?”",GNBDC
1SA,20,11,"“Let's go out to the fields,” Jonathan answered. So they went,",GNBDC
1SA,20,12,"and Jonathan said to David, “May the",GNBDC

1SA,20,14,"And if I remain alive, please keep your sacred promise and be loyal to me; but if I die,",GNBDC
1SA,20,15,show the same kind of loyalty to my family for ever. And when the,GNBDC

1SA,20,17,"Once again Jonathan made David promise to love him, for Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself.",GNBDC
1SA,20,18,"Then Jonathan said to him, “Since tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, your absence will be noticed if you aren't at the meal.",GNBDC
1SA,20,19,The day after tomorrow your absence will be noticed,GNBDC
1SA,20,20,"I will then shoot three arrows at it, as though it were a target.",GNBDC
1SA,20,21,"Then I will tell my servant to go and find them. And if I tell him, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them,’ that means that you are safe and can come out. I swear by the living",GNBDC
1SA,20,22,"But if I tell him, ‘The arrows are on the other side of you,’ then leave, because the",GNBDC
1SA,20,23,"As for the promise we have made to each other, the",GNBDC
1SA,20,24,"So David hid in the fields. At the New Moon Festival, King Saul came to the meal",GNBDC
1SA,20,25,"and sat in his usual place by the wall. Abner sat next to him, and Jonathan sat opposite him.",GNBDC
1SA,20,26,"but Saul said nothing that day, because he thought, “Something has happened to him, and he is not ritually pure.”",GNBDC
1SA,20,27,"On the following day, the day after the New Moon Festival, David's place was still empty, and Saul asked Jonathan, “Why didn't David come to the meal either yesterday or today?”",GNBDC
1SA,20,28,"Jonathan answered, “He begged me to let him go to Bethlehem.",GNBDC
1SA,20,29,"‘Please let me go,’ he said, ‘because our family is celebrating the sacrificial feast in town, and my brother ordered me to be there. So then, if you are my friend, let me go and see my relatives.’ That is why he isn't in his place at your table.”",GNBDC
1SA,20,30,"Saul was furious with Jonathan and said to him, “How rebellious and faithless your mother was! Now I know you are taking sides with David and are disgracing yourself and that mother of yours!",GNBDC
1SA,20,31,"Don't you realize that as long as David is alive, you will never be king of this country? Now go and bring him here — he must die!”",GNBDC
1SA,20,32,“Why should he die?” Jonathan replied. “What has he done?”,GNBDC
1SA,20,33,"At that, Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him, and Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David.",GNBDC
1SA,20,34,"Jonathan got up from the table in a rage and ate nothing that day — the second day of the New Moon Festival. He was deeply distressed about David, because Saul had insulted him.",GNBDC
1SA,20,35,"The following morning Jonathan went to the fields to meet David, as they had agreed. He took a young boy with him",GNBDC
1SA,20,36,"and said to him, “Run and find the arrows I'm going to shoot.” The boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.",GNBDC
1SA,20,37,"When the boy reached the place where the arrow had fallen, Jonathan shouted to him, “The arrow is further on!",GNBDC
1SA,20,38,"Don't just stand there! Hurry up!” The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master,",GNBDC
1SA,20,39,not knowing what it all meant; only Jonathan and David knew.,GNBDC
1SA,20,40,Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him to take them back to the town.,GNBDC
1SA,20,41,"After the boy had left, David got up from behind the pile of stones,",GNBDC
1SA,20,42,"Then Jonathan said to David, “God be with you. The",GNBDC
1SA,21,2,"“I am here on the king's business,” David answered. “He told me not to let anyone know what he sent me to do. As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place.",GNBDC
1SA,21,3,"Now, then, what supplies have you got? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have.”",GNBDC
1SA,21,4,"The priest said, “I haven't any ordinary bread, only sacred bread; you can have it if your men haven't had sexual relations recently.”",GNBDC
1SA,21,5,"“Of course they haven't,” answered David. “My men always keep themselves ritually pure even when we go out on an ordinary mission; how much more this time when we are on a special mission!”",GNBDC
1SA,21,7,"(Saul's chief herdsman, Doeg, who was from Edom, happened to be there that day, because he had to fulfil a religious obligation.)",GNBDC
1SA,21,8,"David said to Ahimelech, “Have you got a spear or a sword you can give me? The king's orders made me leave in such a hurry that I didn't have time to get my sword or any other weapon.”",GNBDC
1SA,21,?,"“Give it to me,” David said. “There is not a better sword anywhere!”",GNBDC
1SA,21,10,"So David left, fleeing from Saul, and went to King Achish of Gath.",GNBDC
1SA,21,11,"The king's officials said to Achish, “Isn't this David, the king of his country? This is the man about whom the women sang, as they danced, ‘Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands.’ ”",GNBDC
1SA,21,13,"So whenever they were around, David pretended to be insane and acted like a madman when they tried to restrain him; he would scribble on the city",GNBDC
1SA,21,14,"So Achish said to his officials, “Look! The man is mad! Why did you bring him to me?",GNBDC
1SA,21,15,Haven't I got enough madmen already? Why bring another one to annoy me with his daft actions right here in my own house?”,GNBDC
1SA,22,2,"People who were oppressed or in debt or dissatisfied went to him, about 400 men in all, and he became their leader.",GNBDC
1SA,22,3,"David went on from there to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I find out what God is going to do for me.”",GNBDC
1SA,22,4,"So David left his parents with the king of Moab, and they stayed there as long as David was hiding in the cave.",GNBDC
1SA,22,5,"Then the prophet Gad came to David and said, “Don't stay here; go at once to the land of Judah.” So David left and went to the forest of Hereth.",GNBDC
1SA,22,6,"One day Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under a tamarisk tree on a hill, with his spear in his hand, and all his officers were standing round him. He was told that David and his men had been found,",GNBDC
1SA,22,7,"and he said to his officers, “Listen, men of Benjamin! Do you think that David will give fields and vineyards to all of you, and make you officers in his army?",GNBDC
1SA,22,8,"Is that why you are plotting against me? Not one of you told me that my own son had made an alliance with David. No one is concerned about me or tells me that David, one of my own men, is at this moment looking for a chance to kill me, and that my son has encouraged him!”",GNBDC
1SA,22,10,Ahimelech asked the,GNBDC
1SA,22,11,"So King Saul sent for the priest Ahimelech and all his relatives, who were also priests in Nob, and they came to him.",GNBDC
1SA,22,12,"Saul said to Ahimelech, “Listen, Ahimelech!”",GNBDC
1SA,22,?,"“At your service, sir,” he answered.",GNBDC
1SA,22,13,"Saul asked him, “Why are you and David plotting against me? Why did you give him some food and a sword, and consult God for him? Now he has turned against me and is waiting for a chance to kill me!”",GNBDC
1SA,22,14,"Ahimelech answered, “David is the most faithful officer you have! He is your own son-in-law, captain of",GNBDC

1SA,22,19,"Saul also ordered all the other inhabitants of Nob, the city of priests, to be put to death: men and women, children and babies, cattle, donkeys, and sheep — they were all killed.",GNBDC
1SA,22,20,"But Abiathar, one of Ahimelech's sons, escaped, and went and joined David.",GNBDC
1SA,22,21,He told him how Saul had slaughtered the priests of the,GNBDC

1SA,22,23,"Stay with me and don't be afraid. Saul wants to kill both you and me, but you will be safe with me.”",GNBDC
1SA,23,1,David heard that the Philistines were attacking the town of Keilah and were stealing the newly harvested corn.,GNBDC
1SA,23,2,So he asked the,GNBDC
1SA,23,?,"“Yes,” the",GNBDC
1SA,23,3,"But David's men said to him, “We have enough to be afraid of here in Judah; it will be much worse if we go to Keilah and attack the Philistine forces!”",GNBDC
1SA,23,4,So David consulted the,GNBDC
1SA,23,5,So David and his men went to Keilah and attacked the Philistines; they killed many of them and took their livestock. And that was how David saved the town.,GNBDC
1SA,23,6,"When Abiathar son of Ahimelech escaped and joined David in Keilah, he took the ephod with him.",GNBDC
1SA,23,7,"Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, “God has put him in my power. David has trapped himself by going into a walled town with fortified gates.”",GNBDC
1SA,23,8,"So Saul called his troops to war, to march against Keilah and besiege David and his men.",GNBDC
1SA,23,9,"When David heard that Saul was planning to attack him, he said to the priest Abiathar, “Bring the ephod here.”",GNBDC
1SA,23,10,"Then David said, “",GNBDC

1SA,23,13,"So David and his men — about 600 in all — left Keilah at once and kept on the move. When Saul heard that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up his plan.",GNBDC
1SA,23,14,"David stayed in hiding in the hill country, in the wilderness near Ziph. Saul was always trying to find him, but God did not hand David over to him.",GNBDC
1SA,23,15,David saw that Saul was out to kill him.,GNBDC

1SA,23,18,"The two of them made a sacred promise of friendship to each other. David stayed at Horesh, and Jonathan went home.",GNBDC
1SA,23,20,"We know, Your Majesty, how much you want to capture him; so come to our territory, and we will make sure that you catch him.”",GNBDC
1SA,23,21,"Saul answered, “May the",GNBDC
1SA,23,22,Go and make sure once more; find out for certain where he is and who has seen him there. I hear that he is very cunning.,GNBDC
1SA,23,23,"Find out exactly the places where he hides, and be sure to bring back a report to me straight away. Then I will go with you, and if he is still in the region, I will hunt him down, even if I have to search the whole land of Judah.”",GNBDC
1SA,23,24,"So they left and returned to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in a desolate valley in the southern part of the Judean wilderness.",GNBDC
1SA,23,25,"Saul and his men set out to look for David, but he heard about it and went to a rocky hill in the wilderness of Maon and stayed there. When Saul heard about this, he went after David.",GNBDC
1SA,23,26,"Saul and his men were on one side of the hill, separated from David and his men, who were on the other side. They were hurrying to get away from Saul and his men, who were closing in on them and were about to capture them.",GNBDC
1SA,23,27,"Just then a messenger arrived and said to Saul, “Come back at once! The Philistines are invading the country!”",GNBDC
1SA,23,28,So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to fight the Philistines. That is why that place is called Separation Hill.,GNBDC
1SA,23,29,"David left and went to the region of Engedi, where he stayed in hiding.",GNBDC
1SA,24,1,"When Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, he was told that David was in the wilderness near Engedi.",GNBDC
1SA,24,2,"Saul took 3,000 of the best soldiers in Israel and went looking for David and his men east of Wild Goat Rocks.",GNBDC
1SA,24,3,He came to a cave close to some sheep pens by the road and went in to relieve himself. It happened to be the very cave in which David and his men were hiding far back in the cave.,GNBDC

1SA,25,2-3,"There was a man of the clan of Caleb named Nabal, who was from the town of Maon, and who owned land near the town of Carmel. He was a very rich man, the owner of 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats. His wife Abigail was beautiful and intelligent, but he was a mean, bad-tempered man.",GNBDC
1SA,25,?,"Nabal was shearing his sheep in Carmel,",GNBDC

1SA,25,9,"David's men delivered this message to Nabal in David's name. Then they waited there,",GNBDC
1SA,25,10,"and Nabal finally answered, “David? Who is he? I've never heard of him! The country is full of runaway slaves nowadays!",GNBDC
1SA,25,11,"I'm not going to take my bread and water, and the animals I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give them to people who come from I don't know where!”",GNBDC
1SA,25,12,David's men went back to him and told him what Nabal had said.,GNBDC
1SA,25,13,"“Buckle on your swords!” he ordered, and they all did. David also buckled on his sword and left with about 400 of his men, leaving 200 behind with the supplies.",GNBDC
1SA,25,14,"One of Nabal's servants said to Nabal's wife Abigail, “Have you heard? David sent some messengers from the wilderness with greetings for our master, but he insulted them.",GNBDC

1SA,26,13,"Then David crossed over to the other side of the valley to the top of the hill, a safe distance away,",GNBDC
1SA,26,14,"and shouted to Saul's troops and to Abner, “Abner! Can you hear me?”",GNBDC
1SA,26,?,“Who is that shouting and waking up the king?” Abner asked.,GNBDC
1SA,26,15,"David answered, “Abner, aren't you the greatest man in Israel? So why aren't you protecting your master, the king? Just now someone entered the camp to kill your master.",GNBDC
1SA,26,16,"You failed in your duty, Abner! I swear by the living",GNBDC
1SA,26,17,"Saul recognized David's voice and asked, “David, is that you, my son?”",GNBDC
1SA,26,?,"“Yes, Your Majesty,” David answered.",GNBDC
1SA,26,18,"And he added, “Why, sir, are you still pursuing me, your servant? What have I done? What crime have I committed?",GNBDC

1SA,26,22,"David replied, “Here is your spear, Your Majesty. Let one of your men come over and get it.",GNBDC
1SA,26,23,The,GNBDC

1SA,26,25,"Saul said to David, “God bless you, my son! You will succeed in everything you do!”",GNBDC
1SA,26,?,"So David went on his way, and Saul returned home.",GNBDC
1SA,27,1,"David said to himself, “One of these days Saul will kill me. The best thing for me to do is to escape to Philistia. Then Saul will give up looking for me in Israel, and I will be safe.”",GNBDC
1SA,27,2,"So David and his 600 men went over at once to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath.",GNBDC
1SA,27,3,"David and his men settled there in Gath with their families. David had his two wives with him, Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal's widow, from Carmel.",GNBDC
1SA,27,4,"When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he gave up trying to find him.",GNBDC
1SA,27,5,"David said to Achish, “If you are my friend, let me have a small town to live in. There is no need, sir, for me to live with you in the capital city.”",GNBDC
1SA,27,6,"So Achish gave him the town of Ziklag, and for this reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since.",GNBDC
1SA,27,7,David lived in Philistia for sixteen months.,GNBDC
1SA,27,8,"During that time David and his men would attack the people of Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek, who had been living in the region a very long time. He would raid their land as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt,",GNBDC
1SA,27,9,"killing all the men and women and taking the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and even the clothes. Then he would come back to Achish,",GNBDC
1SA,27,10,"who would ask him, “Where did you go on a raid this time?” and David would tell him that he had gone to the southern part of Judah or to the territory of the clan of Jerahmeel or to the territory where the Kenites lived.",GNBDC
1SA,27,11,"David would kill everyone, men and women, so that no one could go back to Gath and report what he and his men had really done. This is what David did the whole time he lived in Philistia.",GNBDC
1SA,27,12,"But Achish trusted David and said to himself, “He is hated so much by his own people the Israelites that he will have to serve me all his life.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,1,"Some time later, the Philistines gathered their troops to fight Israel, and Achish said to David, “Of course you understand that you and your men are to fight on my side.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,2,"“Of course,” David answered. “I am your servant, and you will see for yourself what I can do.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"Achish said, “Good! I will make you my permanent bodyguard.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,4,The Philistine troops assembled and camped near the town of Shunem; Saul gathered the Israelites and camped at Mount Gilboa.,GNBDC
1SA,28,5,"When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was terrified,",GNBDC
1SA,28,6,and so he asked the,GNBDC
1SA,28,7,"Then Saul ordered his officials, “Find me a woman who is a medium, and I will go and consult her.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"“There is one in Endor,” they answered.",GNBDC
1SA,28,8,"So Saul disguised himself; he put on different clothes, and after dark he went with two of his men to see the woman. “Consult the spirits for me and tell me what is going to happen,” he said to her. “Call up the spirit of the man I name.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,9,"The woman answered, “Surely you know what King Saul has done, how he forced the fortune tellers and mediums to leave Israel.",GNBDC
1SA,28,10,Then Saul made a sacred vow. “By the living,GNBDC
1SA,28,11,“Whom shall I call up for you?” the woman asked.,GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"“Samuel,” he answered.",GNBDC
1SA,28,12,"When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and said to Saul, “Why have you tricked me? You are King Saul!”",GNBDC
1SA,28,13,“Don't be afraid!” the king said to her. “What do you see?”,GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"“I see a spirit coming up from the earth,” she answered.",GNBDC
1SA,28,14,“What does it look like?” he asked.,GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"“It's an old man coming up,” she answered. “He is wearing a cloak.”",GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed to the ground in respect.",GNBDC
1SA,28,15,"Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me? Why did you make me come back?”",GNBDC
1SA,28,?,"Saul answered, “I am in great trouble! The Philistines are at war with me, and God has abandoned me. He doesn't answer me any more, either by prophets or by dreams. And so I have called you, for you to tell me what I must do.”",GNBDC

1SA,28,20,"At once Saul fell down and lay stretched out on the ground, terrified by what Samuel had said. He was weak, because he had not eaten anything all day and all night.",GNBDC
1SA,28,21,"The woman went over to him and saw that he was terrified, so she said to him, “Please, sir, I risked my life by doing what you asked.",GNBDC
1SA,28,22,Now please do what I ask. Let me prepare some food for you. You must eat so that you will be strong enough to travel.”,GNBDC
1SA,28,23,"Saul refused and said he would not eat anything. But his officers also urged him to eat. He finally gave in, got up from the ground, and sat on the bed.",GNBDC
1SA,28,24,"The woman quickly killed a calf which she had been fattening. Then she took some flour, prepared it, and baked some bread without yeast.",GNBDC
1SA,28,25,"She set the food before Saul and his officers, and they ate it. And they left that same night.",GNBDC
1SA,29,1,"The Philistines brought all their troops together at Aphek, while the Israelites camped at the spring in the Valley of Jezreel.",GNBDC
1SA,29,2,The five Philistine kings marched out with their units of a hundred and of a thousand men; David and his men marched in the rear with King Achish.,GNBDC
1SA,29,3,"The Philistine commanders saw them and asked, “What are these Hebrews doing here?”",GNBDC
1SA,29,?,"Achish answered, “This is David, an official of King Saul of Israel. He has been with me for quite a long time now. He has done nothing I can find fault with since the day he came over to me.”",GNBDC
1SA,29,4,"But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said to him, “Send that fellow back to the town you gave him. Don't let him go into battle with us; he might turn against us during the fighting. What better way is there for him to win back his master's favour than by the death of our men?",GNBDC
1SA,29,5,"After all, this is David, the one about whom the women sang, as they danced, ‘Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands.’ ”",GNBDC
1SA,29,6,"Achish called David and said to him, “I swear by the living",GNBDC
1SA,29,7,"So go back home in peace, and don't do anything that would displease them.”",GNBDC
1SA,29,8,"David answered, “What have I done wrong, sir? If, as you say, you haven't found any fault in me since the day I started serving you, why shouldn't I go with you, my master and king, and fight your enemies?”",GNBDC
1SA,29,9,"“I agree,” Achish replied. “I consider you as loyal as an angel of God. But the other kings have said that you can't go with us into battle.",GNBDC
1SA,29,10,"So then, David, tomorrow morning all of you who left Saul and came over to me will have to get up early and leave as soon as it's light.”",GNBDC
1SA,29,11,"So David and his men started out early the following morning to go back to Philistia, and the Philistines went on to Jezreel.",GNBDC
1SA,30,1,Two days later David and his men arrived back at Ziklag. The Amalekites had raided southern Judah and attacked Ziklag. They had burnt down the town,GNBDC
1SA,30,2,"and captured all the women; they had not killed anyone, but had taken everyone with them when they left.",GNBDC
1SA,30,3,"When David and his men arrived, they found that the town had been burnt down and that their wives, sons, and daughters had been carried away.",GNBDC
1SA,30,4,David and his men started crying and did not stop until they were completely exhausted.,GNBDC
1SA,30,5,"Even David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken away.",GNBDC
1SA,30,6,"David was now in great trouble, because his men were all very bitter about losing their children, and they were threatening to stone him; but the",GNBDC
1SA,30,7,"David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, “Bring me the ephod,” and Abiathar brought it to him.",GNBDC
1SA,30,8,David asked the,GNBDC
1SA,30,?,"He answered, “Go after them; you will catch them and rescue the captives.”",GNBDC
1SA,30,9,"So David and his 600 men started out, and when they arrived at the brook of Besor, some of them stayed there.",GNBDC
1SA,30,10,David continued on his way with 400 men; the other 200 men were too tired to cross the brook and so stayed behind.,GNBDC
1SA,30,11,"The men with David found an Egyptian out in the country and brought him to David. They gave him some food and water,",GNBDC
1SA,30,12,"some dried figs, and two bunches of raisins. After he had eaten, his strength returned; he had not had anything to eat or drink for three full days.",GNBDC
1SA,30,13,"David asked him, “Who is your master, and where are you from?”",GNBDC
1SA,30,?,"“I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite,” he answered. “My master left me behind three days ago because I was ill.",GNBDC
1SA,30,14,"We had raided the territory of the Cherethites in the southern part of Judah and the territory of the clan of Caleb, and we burnt down Ziklag.”",GNBDC
1SA,30,15,“Will you lead me to those raiders?” David asked him.,GNBDC
1SA,30,?,"He answered, “I will if you promise me in God's name that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master.”",GNBDC
1SA,30,16,And he led David to them.,GNBDC
1SA,30,?,"The raiders were scattered all over the place, eating, drinking, and celebrating because of the enormous amount of loot they had captured from Philistia and Judah.",GNBDC
1SA,30,17,"At dawn the next day David attacked them and fought until evening. Except for 400 young men who mounted camels and got away, none of them escaped.",GNBDC
1SA,30,18,"David rescued everyone and everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives;",GNBDC
1SA,30,19,"nothing at all was missing. David got back all his men's sons and daughters, and all the loot the Amalekites had taken.",GNBDC
1SA,30,20,He also recovered all the flocks and herds; his men drove all the livestock in front of them,GNBDC
1SA,30,21,"Then David went back to the 200 men who had been too weak to go with him and had stayed behind at the brook of Besor. They came forward to meet David and his men, and David went up to them and greeted them warmly.",GNBDC
1SA,30,22,"But some mean and worthless men who had gone with David said, “They didn't go with us, and so we won't give them any of the loot. They can take their wives and children and go away.”",GNBDC
1SA,30,23,"But David answered, “My brothers, you can't do this with what the",GNBDC
1SA,30,24,No one can agree with what you say! All must share alike: whoever stays behind with the supplies gets the same share as the one who goes into battle.”,GNBDC
1SA,30,25,"David made this a rule, and it has been followed in Israel ever since.",GNBDC
1SA,30,26,"When David returned to Ziklag, he sent part of the loot to his friends, the leaders of Judah, with the message, “Here is a present for you from the loot we took from the",GNBDC
1SA,30,27,"He sent it to the people in Bethel, to the people in Ramah in the southern part of Judah, and to the people in the towns of Jattir,",GNBDC

1SA,30,29,"and Racal; to the clan of Jerahmeel, to the Kenites,",GNBDC
1SA,30,30,"and to the people in the towns of Hormah, Borashan, Athach,",GNBDC
1SA,30,31,and Hebron. He sent it to all the places where he and his men had roamed.,GNBDC
1SA,31,1,"The Philistines fought a battle against the Israelites on Mount Gilboa. Many Israelites were killed there, and the rest of them, including King Saul and his sons, fled.",GNBDC
1SA,31,2,"But the Philistines caught up with them and killed three of Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua.",GNBDC
1SA,31,3,"The fighting was heavy round Saul, and he himself was hit by enemy arrows and badly wounded.",GNBDC
1SA,31,4,"He said to the young man carrying his weapons, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that these godless Philistines won't gloat over me and kill me.” But the young man was too terrified to do it. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it.",GNBDC
1SA,31,5,"The young man saw that Saul was dead, so he too threw himself on his own sword and died with Saul.",GNBDC
1SA,31,6,"And that is how Saul, his three sons, and the young man died; all of Saul's men died that day.",GNBDC
1SA,31,7,"When the Israelites on the other side of the Valley of Jezreel and east of the River Jordan heard that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had been killed, they abandoned their towns and fled. Then the Philistines came and occupied them.",GNBDC
1SA,31,8,"The day after the battle the Philistines went to plunder the corpses, and they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons lying on Mount Gilboa.",GNBDC
1SA,31,9,"They cut off Saul's head, stripped off his armour, and sent messengers with them throughout Philistia to tell the good news to their idols and to their people.",GNBDC
1SA,31,10,"Then they put his weapons in the temple of the goddess Astarte, and they nailed his body to the wall of the city of Beth Shan.",GNBDC
1SA,31,11,"When the people of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,",GNBDC
1SA,31,12,"the bravest men started out and marched all night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall, brought them back to Jabesh, and burnt them there.",GNBDC
1SA,31,13,"Then they took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in the town, and fasted for seven days.",GNBDC
2SA,1,1,After Saul's death David came back from his victory over the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag for two days.,GNBDC
2SA,1,2,"The next day a young man arrived from Saul's camp. To show his grief, he had torn his clothes and put earth on his head. He went to David and bowed to the ground in respect.",GNBDC
2SA,1,3,"David asked him, “Where have you come from?”",GNBDC
2SA,1,?,"“I have escaped from the Israelite camp,” he answered.",GNBDC
2SA,1,4,"“Tell me what happened,” David said.",GNBDC
2SA,1,?,"“Our army ran away from the battle,” he replied, “and many of our men were killed. Saul and his son Jonathan were also killed.”",GNBDC
2SA,1,5,“How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?” David asked him.,GNBDC
2SA,1,7,"Then he turned round, saw me, and called to me. I answered, ‘Yes, sir!’",GNBDC
2SA,1,8,"He asked who I was, and I told him that I was an Amalekite.",GNBDC
2SA,1,9,"Then he said, ‘Come here and kill me! I have been badly wounded, and I'm about to die.’",GNBDC
2SA,1,10,"So I went up to him and killed him, because I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them to you, sir.”",GNBDC
2SA,1,11,"David tore his clothes in sorrow, and all his men did the same.",GNBDC
2SA,1,12,"They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of the",GNBDC

2SA,1,14,"David asked him, “How is it that you dared to kill the",GNBDC
2SA,1,15,"Then David called one of his men and said, “Kill him!” The man struck the Amalekite and mortally wounded him,",GNBDC

2SA,3,14,"And David also sent messengers to Ishbosheth to say, “Give me back my wife Michal. I paid a hundred Philistine foreskins in order to marry her.”",GNBDC
2SA,3,15,So Ishbosheth took her away from her husband Paltiel son of Laish.,GNBDC
2SA,3,16,"Paltiel followed her all the way to the town of Bahurim, crying as he went. But when Abner said, “Go back home,” he did.",GNBDC
2SA,3,17,"Abner went to the leaders of Israel and said to them, “For a long time you have wanted David to be your king.",GNBDC
2SA,3,18,Now here is your chance. Remember that the,GNBDC
2SA,3,19,Abner spoke also to the people of the tribe of Benjamin and then went to Hebron to tell David what the people of Benjamin and of Israel had agreed to do.,GNBDC
2SA,3,20,"When Abner came to David at Hebron with twenty men, David gave a feast for them.",GNBDC
2SA,3,21,"Abner told David, “I will go now and win all Israel over to Your Majesty. They will accept you as king, and then you will get what you have wanted and will rule over the whole land.” David gave Abner a guarantee of safety and sent him on his way.",GNBDC
2SA,3,22,"Later on Joab and David's other officials returned from a raid, bringing a large amount of loot with them. Abner, however, was no longer there at Hebron with David, because David had sent him away with a guarantee of safety.",GNBDC
2SA,3,23,"When Joab and his men arrived, he was told that Abner had come to King David and had been sent away with a guarantee of safety.",GNBDC
2SA,3,24,"So Joab went to the king and said to him, “What have you done? Abner came to you — why did you let him go like that?",GNBDC
2SA,3,25,He came here to deceive you and to find out everything you do and everywhere you go. Surely you know that!”,GNBDC
2SA,3,26,"After leaving David, Joab sent messengers to get Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew nothing about it.",GNBDC
2SA,3,27,"When Abner arrived in Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate, as though he wanted to speak privately with him, and there he stabbed him in the belly. And so Abner was murdered because he had killed Joab's brother Asahel.",GNBDC
2SA,3,28,"When David heard the news, he said, “The",GNBDC
2SA,3,29,May the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhoea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a woman's work or is killed in battle or hasn't enough to eat!”,GNBDC
2SA,3,30,So Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge on Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.,GNBDC
2SA,3,31,"Then David ordered Joab and his men to tear their clothes, wear sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And at the funeral King David himself walked behind the coffin.",GNBDC
2SA,3,32,"Abner was buried at Hebron, and the king wept aloud at the grave, and so did all the people.",GNBDC
2SA,3,33,David sang this lament for Abner:,GNBDC

2SA,3,36,"They took note of this and were pleased. Indeed, everything the king did pleased the people.",GNBDC
2SA,3,37,All David's people and all the people in Israel understood that the king had no part in the murder of Abner.,GNBDC
2SA,3,38,"The king said to his officials, “Don't you realize that this day a great leader in Israel has died?",GNBDC

2SA,4,7,"Once inside, they went to Ishbosheth's bedroom, where he was sound asleep, and killed him. Then they cut off his head, took it with them, and walked all night through the Jordan Valley.",GNBDC

2SA,4,12,"David gave the order, and his soldiers killed Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet, which they hung up near the pool in Hebron. They took Ishbosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb there at Hebron.",GNBDC
2SA,5,1,"Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said to him, “We are your own flesh and blood.",GNBDC

2SA,12,18,"A week later the child died, and David's officials were afraid to tell him the news. They said, “While the child was living, David wouldn't answer us when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that his child is dead? He might do himself some harm!”",GNBDC
2SA,12,19,"When David noticed them whispering to each other, he realized that the child had died. So he asked them, “Is the child dead?”",GNBDC
2SA,12,?,"“Yes, he is,” they answered.",GNBDC

2SA,12,26,"Meanwhile Joab continued his campaign against Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon, and was about to capture it.",GNBDC
2SA,12,27,He sent messengers to David to report: “I have attacked Rabbah and have captured its water supply.,GNBDC
2SA,12,28,"Now gather the rest of your forces, attack the city and take it yourself. I don't want to get the credit for capturing it.”",GNBDC
2SA,12,29,"So David gathered his forces, went to Rabbah, attacked it, and conquered it.",GNBDC
2SA,12,30,From the head of the idol of the Ammonite god Molech,GNBDC

2SA,13,2,"He was so much in love with her that he became ill, because it seemed impossible for him to have her; as a virgin, she was kept from meeting men.",GNBDC
2SA,13,3,"But he had a friend, a very shrewd man named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah.",GNBDC
2SA,13,4,"Jonadab said to Amnon, “You are the king's son, yet day after day I see you looking sad. What's the matter?”",GNBDC
2SA,13,?,"“I'm in love with Tamar, the sister of my half-brother Absalom,” he answered.",GNBDC
2SA,13,5,"Jonadab said to him, “Pretend that you are ill and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him, ‘Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to prepare the food here where I can see her, and then serve it to me herself.’ ”",GNBDC
2SA,13,6,So Amnon pretended that he was ill and went to bed.,GNBDC
2SA,13,?,"King David went to see him, and Amnon said to him, “Please let Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her, and then serve them to me herself.”",GNBDC
2SA,13,7,So David sent word to Tamar in the palace: “Go to Amnon's house and prepare some food for him.”,GNBDC
2SA,13,8,"She went there and found him in bed. She took some dough, prepared it, and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes",GNBDC
2SA,13,9,"and emptied them out of the pan for him to eat, but he wouldn't. He said, “Send everyone away” — and they all left.",GNBDC
2SA,13,10,"Then he said to her, “Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me yourself.” She took the cakes and went over to him.",GNBDC
2SA,13,11,"As she offered them to him, he grabbed her and said, “Come to bed with me!”",GNBDC
2SA,13,12,"“No,” she said. “Don't force me to do such a degrading thing! That's awful!",GNBDC
2SA,13,13,"How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you — you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please, speak to the king, and I'm sure that he will give me to you.”",GNBDC
2SA,13,14,"But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her.",GNBDC
2SA,13,15,"Then Amnon was filled with a deep hatred for her; he hated her now even more than he had loved her before. He said to her, “Get out!”",GNBDC
2SA,13,16,"“No,” she answered. “To send me away like this is a greater crime",GNBDC
2SA,13,?,But Amnon would not listen to her;,GNBDC
2SA,13,17,"he called in his personal servant and said, “Get this woman out of my sight! Throw her out and lock the door!”",GNBDC

2SA,13,20,"When her brother Absalom saw her, he asked, “Has Amnon molested you? Please, sister, don't let it upset you so much. He is your half-brother, so don't tell anyone about it.” So Tamar lived in Absalom's house, sad and lonely.",GNBDC
2SA,13,21,"When King David heard what had happened, he was furious.",GNBDC
2SA,13,22,And Absalom hated Amnon so much for having raped his sister Tamar that he would no longer even speak to him.,GNBDC
2SA,13,23,"Two years later Absalom was having his sheep sheared at Baal Hazor, near the town of Ephraim, and he invited all the king's sons to be there.",GNBDC
2SA,13,24,"He went to King David and said, “Your Majesty, I am having my sheep sheared. Will you and your officials come and take part in the festivities?”",GNBDC
2SA,13,25,"“No, my son,” the king answered. “It would be too much trouble for you if we all went.” Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in, and he asked Absalom to leave.",GNBDC
2SA,13,26,"But Absalom said, “Well, then, will you at least let my brother Amnon come?”",GNBDC
2SA,13,?,“Why should he?” the king asked.,GNBDC
2SA,13,27,But Absalom kept on insisting until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom.,GNBDC
2SA,13,#,Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king,GNBDC
2SA,13,28,"and instructed his servants: “Notice when Amnon has had too much to drink, and then when I give the order, kill him. Don't be afraid. I will take the responsibility myself. Be brave and don't hesitate!”",GNBDC
2SA,13,29,So the servants followed Absalom's instructions and killed Amnon. All the rest of David's sons mounted their mules and fled.,GNBDC
2SA,13,30,"While they were on their way home, David was told: “Absalom has killed all your sons — not one of them is left!”",GNBDC
2SA,13,31,"The king stood up, tore his clothes in sorrow, and threw himself to the ground. The servants who were there with him tore their clothes also.",GNBDC
2SA,13,32,"But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah, said, “Your Majesty, they haven't killed all your sons. Only Amnon is dead. You could tell by looking at Absalom that he had made up his mind to do this from the time that Amnon raped his sister Tamar.",GNBDC
2SA,13,33,So don't believe the news that all your sons are dead; only Amnon was killed.”,GNBDC
2SA,13,34,In the meantime Absalom had fled.,GNBDC
2SA,13,#,Just then the soldier on sentry duty saw a large crowd coming down the hill on the road from Horonaim.,GNBDC
2SA,13,35,"Jonadab said to David, “Those are your sons coming, just as I said they would.”",GNBDC
2SA,13,36,"As soon as he finished saying this, David's sons came in; they started crying, and David and his officials also wept bitterly.",GNBDC
2SA,13,39,"but when he got over Amnon's death, he was filled with longing for his son Absalom.",GNBDC
2SA,14,1,"Joab knew that King David missed Absalom very much,",GNBDC
2SA,14,2,"so he sent for a clever woman who lived in Tekoa. When she arrived, he said to her, “Pretend that you are in mourning; put on your mourning clothes, and don't comb your hair. Act like a woman who has been in mourning for a long time.",GNBDC
2SA,14,3,Then go to the king and say to him what I tell you to say.” Then Joab told her what to say.,GNBDC
2SA,14,4,"The woman went to the king, bowed down to the ground in respect, and said, “Help me, Your Majesty!”",GNBDC
2SA,14,5,“What do you want?” he asked her.,GNBDC
2SA,14,?,"“I am a poor widow, sir,” she answered. “My husband is dead.",GNBDC
2SA,14,6,"Sir, I had two sons, and one day they got into a quarrel out in the fields, where there was no one to separate them, and one of them killed the other.",GNBDC
2SA,14,7,"And now, sir, all my relatives have turned against me and are demanding that I hand my son over to them, so that they can kill him for murdering his brother. If they do this, I will be left without a son. They will destroy my last hope and leave my husband without a son to keep his name alive.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,8,"“Go back home,” the king answered, “and I will take care of the matter.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,9,"“Your Majesty,” she said, “whatever you do, my family and I will take the blame; you and the royal family are innocent.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,10,"The king replied, “If anyone threatens you, bring him to me, and he will never trouble you again.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,11,"She said, “Your Majesty, please pray to the",GNBDC
2SA,14,?,“I promise by the living,GNBDC
2SA,14,12,"“Please, Your Majesty, let me say just one more thing,” the woman said.",GNBDC
2SA,14,?,"“All right,” he answered.",GNBDC
2SA,14,13,"She said to him, “Why have you done such a wrong to God's people? You have not allowed your own son to return from exile, and so you have condemned yourself by what you have just said.",GNBDC
2SA,14,14,"We will all die; we are like water spilt on the ground, which can't be gathered again. Even God does not bring the dead back to life, but the king can at least find a way to bring a man back from exile.",GNBDC
2SA,14,15,"Now, Your Majesty, the reason I have come to speak to you is that the people threatened me, and so I said to myself that I would speak to you in the hope that you would do what I ask.",GNBDC
2SA,14,16,I thought you would listen to me and save me from the one who is trying to kill my son and me and so remove us from the land God gave his people.,GNBDC
2SA,14,17,"I said to myself that your promise, sir, would make me safe, because the king is like God's angel and can distinguish good from evil.",GNBDC
2SA,14,18,"The king answered, “I'm going to ask you a question, and you must tell me the whole truth.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,?,"“Ask me anything, Your Majesty,” she answered.",GNBDC
2SA,14,19,“Did Joab put you up to this?” he asked her.,GNBDC
2SA,14,#,"She answered, “I swear by all that is sacred, Your Majesty, that there is no way to avoid answering your question.",GNBDC
2SA,14,20,But he did it in order to straighten out this whole matter. Your Majesty is as wise as the angel of God and knows everything that happens.”,GNBDC
2SA,14,21,"Later on the king said to Joab, “I have decided to do what you want. Go and get the young man Absalom and bring him back here.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,22,"Joab threw himself to the ground in front of David in respect, and said, “God bless you, Your Majesty! Now I know that you are pleased with me, because you have granted my request.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,23,Then he got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.,GNBDC
2SA,14,24,"The king, however, gave orders that Absalom should not live in the palace. “I don't want to see him,” the king said. So Absalom lived in his own house and did not appear before the king.",GNBDC
2SA,14,25,There was no one in Israel as famous for his good looks as Absalom; he had no defect from head to foot.,GNBDC
2SA,14,26,"His hair was very thick, and he had to cut it once a year, when it grew too long and heavy. It would weigh more than two kilogrammes according to the royal standard of weights.",GNBDC
2SA,14,27,"Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar, a very beautiful woman.",GNBDC
2SA,14,28,Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king.,GNBDC
2SA,14,29,"Then he sent for Joab, to ask him to go to the king for him; but Joab would not come. Again Absalom sent for him, and again Joab refused to come.",GNBDC
2SA,14,30,"So Absalom said to his servants, “Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and it has barley growing in it. Go and set fire to it.” So they went and set the field on fire.",GNBDC
2SA,14,31,"Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, “Why did your servants set fire to my field?”",GNBDC
2SA,14,32,"Absalom answered, “Because you wouldn't come when I sent for you. I wanted you to go to the king and ask him from me: ‘Why did I leave Geshur and come here? It would have been better for me to have stayed there.’ ” And Absalom went on, “I want you to arrange for me to see the king, and if I'm guilty, then let him put me to death.”",GNBDC
2SA,14,33,"So Joab went to King David and told him what Absalom had said. The king sent for Absalom, who went to him and bowed down to the ground in front of him. The king welcomed him with a kiss.",GNBDC
2SA,15,1,"After this, Absalom provided a chariot and horses for himself, and an escort of fifty men.",GNBDC
2SA,15,2,"He would get up early and go and stand by the road at the city gate. Whenever someone came there with a dispute that he wanted the king to settle, Absalom would call him over and ask him where he was from. And after the man had told him what tribe he was from,",GNBDC
2SA,15,3,"Absalom would say, “Look, the law is on your side, but there is no representative of the king to hear your case.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,4,"And he would add, “How I wish I were a judge! Then anyone who had a dispute or a claim could come to me, and I would give him justice.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,5,"When the man approached Absalom to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out, take hold of him, and kiss him.",GNBDC
2SA,15,6,"Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for justice, and so he won their loyalty.",GNBDC
2SA,15,7,After four,GNBDC
2SA,15,8,"While I was living in Geshur in Syria, I promised the",GNBDC
2SA,15,9,"“Go in peace,” the king said. So Absalom went to Hebron.",GNBDC
2SA,15,10,"But he sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel to say, “When you hear the sound of trumpets, shout, ‘Absalom has become king at Hebron!’ ”",GNBDC
2SA,15,11,There were 200 men who at Absalom's invitation had gone from Jerusalem with him; they knew nothing of the plot and went in all good faith.,GNBDC
2SA,15,12,"And while he was offering sacrifices, Absalom also sent to the town of Gilo for Ahithophel, who was one of King David's advisers. The plot against the king gained strength, and Absalom's followers grew in number.",GNBDC
2SA,15,13,"A messenger reported to David, “The Israelites are pledging their loyalty to Absalom.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,14,"So David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, “We must get away at once if we want to escape from Absalom! Hurry! Or else he will soon be here and defeat us and kill everyone in the city!”",GNBDC
2SA,15,15,"“Yes, Your Majesty,” they answered. “We are ready to do whatever you say.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,16,"So the king left, accompanied by all his family and officials, except for ten concubines, whom he left behind to take care of the palace.",GNBDC
2SA,15,17,"As the king and all his men were leaving the city, they stopped at the last house.",GNBDC
2SA,15,18,All his officials stood,GNBDC
2SA,15,19,"and the king said to Ittai, their leader, “Why are you going with us? Go back and stay with the new king. You are a foreigner, a refugee away from your own country.",GNBDC
2SA,15,20,"You have lived here only a short time, so why should I make you wander round with me? I don't even know where I'm going. Go back and take your fellow-countrymen with you — and may the",GNBDC
2SA,15,21,"But Ittai answered, “Your Majesty, I swear to you in the",GNBDC
2SA,15,22,“Fine!” David answered. “March on!” So Ittai went on with all his men and their dependants.,GNBDC
2SA,15,23,"The people cried loudly as David's followers left. The king crossed the brook of Kidron, followed by his men, and together they went out towards the wilderness.",GNBDC
2SA,15,24,"Zadok the priest was there, and with him were the Levites, carrying the sacred Covenant Box. They set it down",GNBDC
2SA,15,25,"Then the king said to Zadok, “Take the Covenant Box back to the city. If the",GNBDC
2SA,15,26,"But if he isn't pleased with me — well, then, let him do to me what he wishes.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,27,"And he went on to say to Zadok, “Look,",GNBDC
2SA,15,28,"Meanwhile, I will wait at the river crossings in the wilderness until I receive news from you.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,29,So Zadok and Abiathar took the Covenant Box back into Jerusalem and stayed there.,GNBDC
2SA,15,30,David went on up the Mount of Olives weeping; he was barefoot and had his head covered as a sign of grief. All who followed him covered their heads and wept also.,GNBDC
2SA,15,31,When David was told,GNBDC
2SA,15,32,"When David reached the top of the hill, where there was a place of worship, his trusted friend Hushai the Archite met him with his clothes torn and with earth on his head.",GNBDC
2SA,15,33,"David said to him, “You will be of no help to me if you come with me,",GNBDC
2SA,15,34,but you can help me by returning to the city and telling Absalom that you will now serve him as faithfully as you served his father. And do all you can to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives.,GNBDC
2SA,15,35,The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be there; tell them everything you hear in the king's palace.,GNBDC
2SA,15,36,"They have their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan with them, and you can send them to me with all the information you gather.”",GNBDC
2SA,15,37,"So Hushai, David's friend, returned to the city just as Absalom was arriving.",GNBDC
2SA,16,2,"King David asked him, “What are you going to do with all that?”",GNBDC
2SA,16,?,"Ziba answered, “The donkeys are for Your Majesty's family to ride, the bread and the fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is for them to drink when they get tired in the wilderness.”",GNBDC
2SA,16,?,"“He is staying in Jerusalem,” Ziba answered, “because he is convinced that the Israelites will now restore to him the kingdom of his grandfather Saul.”",GNBDC
2SA,16,4,"The king said to Ziba, “Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is yours.”",GNBDC
2SA,16,?,"“I am your servant,” Ziba replied. “May I always please Your Majesty!”",GNBDC
2SA,16,5,"When King David arrived at Bahurim, one of Saul's relatives, Shimei son of Gera, came out to meet him, cursing him as he came.",GNBDC
2SA,16,6,"Shimei started throwing stones at David and his officials, even though David was surrounded by his men and his bodyguard.",GNBDC
2SA,16,7,"Shimei cursed him and said, “Get out! Get out! Murderer! Criminal!",GNBDC
2SA,16,8,"You took Saul's kingdom, and now the",GNBDC

2SA,16,12,Perhaps the,GNBDC
2SA,16,13,"So David and his men continued along the road. Shimei kept up with them, walking on the hillside; he was cursing and throwing stones and earth at them as he went.",GNBDC
2SA,16,14,"The king and all his men were worn out when they reached the Jordan,",GNBDC
2SA,16,15,"Absalom and all the Israelites with him entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with them.",GNBDC
2SA,16,16,"When Hushai, David's trusted friend, met Absalom, he shouted, “Long live the king! Long live the king!”",GNBDC
2SA,16,17,“What has happened to your loyalty to your friend David?” Absalom asked him. “Why didn't you go with him?”,GNBDC
2SA,16,18,"Hushai answered, “How could I? I am on the side of the one chosen by the",GNBDC
2SA,16,19,"After all, whom should I serve, if not my master's son? As I served your father, so now I will serve you.”",GNBDC
2SA,16,20,"Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, “Now that we are here, what do you advise us to do?”",GNBDC
2SA,16,21,"Ahithophel answered, “Go and have intercourse with your father's concubines whom he left behind to take care of the palace. Then everyone in Israel will know that your father regards you as his enemy, and your followers will be greatly encouraged.”",GNBDC
2SA,16,22,"So they set up a tent for Absalom on the palace roof, and in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his father's concubines.",GNBDC
2SA,16,23,Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God; both David and Absalom followed it.,GNBDC
2SA,17,1,"Not long after that, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Let me choose 12,000 men, and tonight I will set out after David.",GNBDC
2SA,17,2,"I will attack him while he is tired and discouraged. He will be frightened, and all his men will run away. I will kill only the king",GNBDC
2SA,17,3,"and then bring back all his men to you, like a bride returning to her husband. You want to kill only one man;",GNBDC
2SA,17,4,This seemed like good advice to Absalom and all the Israelite leaders.,GNBDC
2SA,17,5,"Absalom said, “Now call Hushai, and let us hear what he has to say.”",GNBDC
2SA,17,6,"When Hushai arrived, Absalom said to him, “This is the advice that Ahithophel has given us; shall we follow it? If not, you tell us what to do.”",GNBDC
2SA,17,7,"Hushai answered, “The advice Ahithophel gave you this time is no good.",GNBDC
2SA,17,8,You know that your father David and his men are hard fighters and that they are as fierce as a mother bear robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier and does not stay with his men at night.,GNBDC
2SA,17,9,"Just now he is probably hiding in a cave or some other place. As soon as David attacks your men, whoever hears about it will say that your men have been defeated.",GNBDC
2SA,17,10,"Then even the bravest men, as fearless as lions, will be afraid because everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great soldier and that his men are hard fighters.",GNBDC
2SA,17,11,"My advice is that you bring all the Israelites together from one end of the country to the other, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore, and that you lead them personally in battle.",GNBDC
2SA,17,12,"We will find David wherever he is, and attack him before he knows what's happening. Neither he nor any of his men will survive.",GNBDC
2SA,17,13,"If he retreats into a city, our people will all bring ropes and just pull the city",GNBDC
2SA,17,14,"Absalom and all the Israelites said, “Hushai's advice is better than Ahithophel's.” The",GNBDC

2SA,19,1,Joab was told that King David was weeping and mourning for Absalom.,GNBDC

2SA,19,36,I don't deserve such a great reward. So I will go just a little way with you beyond the Jordan.,GNBDC

2SA,20,13,"After the body had been removed from the road, everyone followed Joab in pursuit of Sheba.",GNBDC
2SA,20,14,"Sheba passed through the territory of all the tribes of Israel and came to the city of Abel Beth Maacah, and all the members of the clan of Bikri",GNBDC
2SA,20,15,"Joab's men heard that Sheba was there, and so they went and besieged the city. They built ramps of earth against the outer wall and also began to dig under the wall to make it fall down.",GNBDC
2SA,20,16,"There was a wise woman in the city who shouted from the wall, “Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here; I want to speak with him.”",GNBDC

2KI,6,10,"So the king of Israel warned the people who lived in that place, and they were on guard. This happened several times.",GNBDC
2KI,6,11,"The Syrian king became greatly upset over this; he called in his officers and asked them, “Which one of you is on the side of the king of Israel?”",GNBDC

2KI,6,?,"When he was told that Elisha was in Dothan,",GNBDC
2KI,6,14,he sent a large force there with horses and chariots. They reached the town at night and surrounded it.,GNBDC
2KI,6,15,"Early the next morning Elisha's servant got up, went out of the house, and saw the Syrian troops with their horses and chariots surrounding the town. He went back to Elisha and exclaimed, “We are doomed, sir! What shall we do?”",GNBDC

2KI,6,23,"So the king of Israel provided a great feast for them; and after they had eaten and drunk, he sent them back to the king of Syria. From then on the Syrians stopped raiding the land of Israel.",GNBDC

2KI,7,5,"So, as it began to get dark, they went to the Syrian camp, but when they reached it, no one was there.",GNBDC
2KI,7,6,"The Lord had made the Syrians hear what sounded like the advance of a large army, with horses and chariots, and the Syrians thought that the king of Israel had hired Hittite and Egyptian kings and their armies to attack them.",GNBDC
2KI,7,7,"So that evening the Syrians had fled for their lives, abandoning their tents, horses, and donkeys, and leaving the camp just as it was.",GNBDC
2KI,7,8,"When the four men reached the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, ate and drank what was there, grabbed the silver, gold, and clothing they found, and went off and hid them; then they returned, entered another tent, and did the same thing.",GNBDC
2KI,7,9,"But then they said to each other, “We shouldn't be doing this! We have good news and we shouldn't keep it to ourselves. If we wait until morning to tell it, we are sure to be punished. Let's go at once and tell the king's officers!”",GNBDC
2KI,7,10,"So they left the Syrian camp, went back to Samaria and called out to the guards at the gates: “We went to the Syrian camp and didn't see or hear anybody; the horses and donkeys have not been untied, and the tents are just as the Syrians left them.”",GNBDC
2KI,7,11,"The guards announced the news, and it was reported in the palace.",GNBDC
2KI,7,12,"It was still night, but the king got out of bed and said to his officials, “I'll tell you what the Syrians are planning!

They think that we will leave the city to find food, and then they will take us alive and capture the city.”",GNBDC
2KI,7,13,"One of his officials said, “The people here in the city are doomed anyway, like those that have already died. So let's send some men with five of the horses that are left, so that we can find out what has happened.”",GNBDC
