GEN,1,1,"In the beginning, when God created the universe,",GNBDC
GEN,1,2,"the earth was formless and desolate. The raging ocean that covered everything was engulfed in total darkness, and the Spirit of God",GNBDC
GEN,1,3,"Then God commanded, “Let there be light” — and light appeared.",GNBDC
GEN,1,4,"God was pleased with what he saw. Then he separated the light from the darkness,",GNBDC
GEN,1,5,and he named the light “Day” and the darkness “Night”. Evening passed and morning came — that was the first day.,GNBDC
GEN,1,8,He named the dome “Sky”. Evening passed and morning came — that was the second day.,GNBDC
GEN,1,9,"Then God commanded, “Let the water below the sky come together in one place, so that the land will appear” — and it was done.",GNBDC
GEN,1,10,"He named the land “Earth”, and the water which had come together he named “Sea”. And God was pleased with what he saw.",GNBDC

GEN,1,14,"Then God commanded, “Let lights appear in the sky to separate day from night and to show the time when days, years, and religious festivals",GNBDC
GEN,1,15,they will shine in the sky to give light to the earth” — and it was done.,GNBDC
GEN,1,16,"So God made the two larger lights, the sun to rule over the day and the moon to rule over the night; he also made the stars.",GNBDC
GEN,1,17,"He placed the lights in the sky to shine on the earth,",GNBDC
GEN,1,18,"to rule over the day and the night, and to separate light from darkness. And God was pleased with what he saw.",GNBDC

GEN,1,25,"So God made them all, and he was pleased with what he saw.",GNBDC
GEN,1,27,"So God created human beings, making them to be like himself. He created them male and female,",GNBDC
GEN,1,28,"blessed them, and said, “Have many children, so that your descendants will live all over the earth and bring it under their control. I am putting you in charge of the fish, the birds, and all the wild animals.",GNBDC
GEN,1,29,I have provided all kinds of grain and all kinds of fruit for you to eat;,GNBDC
GEN,1,30,but for all the wild animals and for all the birds I have provided grass and leafy plants for food” — and it was done.,GNBDC
GEN,1,31,"God looked at everything he had made, and he was very pleased. Evening passed and morning came — that was the sixth day.",GNBDC
GEN,2,1,And so the whole universe was completed.,GNBDC
GEN,2,2,By the seventh day God finished what he had been doing and stopped working.,GNBDC
GEN,2,3,"He blessed the seventh day and set it apart as a special day, because by that day he had completed his creation",GNBDC
GEN,2,4,And that is how the universe was created.,GNBDC
GEN,2,#,When the,GNBDC
GEN,2,5,"there were no plants on the earth and no seeds had sprouted, because he had not sent any rain, and there was no one to cultivate the land;",GNBDC
GEN,2,6,but water would come up from beneath the surface and water the ground.,GNBDC
GEN,2,8,Then the,GNBDC
GEN,2,9,He made all kinds of beautiful trees grow there and produce good fruit. In the middle of the garden stood the tree that gives life and the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad.,GNBDC
GEN,2,10,A stream flowed in Eden and watered the garden; beyond Eden it divided into four rivers.,GNBDC
GEN,2,11,The first river is the Pishon; it flows round the country of Havilah.,GNBDC
GEN,2,12,(Pure gold is found there and also rare perfume and precious stones.),GNBDC
GEN,2,13,The second river is the Gihon; it flows round the country of Cush.,GNBDC
GEN,2,14,"The third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria, and the fourth river is the Euphrates.",GNBDC
GEN,2,15,Then the,GNBDC
GEN,2,16,"He said to him, “You may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden,",GNBDC
GEN,2,17,except the tree that gives knowledge of what is good and what is bad.,GNBDC
GEN,2,18,Then the,GNBDC
GEN,2,19,So he took some soil from the ground and formed all the animals and all the birds. Then he brought them to the man to see what he would name them; and that is how they all got their names.,GNBDC
GEN,2,20,So the man named all the birds and all the animals; but not one of them was a suitable companion to help him.,GNBDC
GEN,2,21,Then the,GNBDC
GEN,2,22,He formed a woman out of the rib and brought her to him.,GNBDC
GEN,2,23,"Then the man said,",GNBDC
GEN,2,?,"“At last, here is one of my own kind —",GNBDC
GEN,2,?,"Bone taken from my bone, and flesh from my flesh.",GNBDC
GEN,2,#,‘Woman’ is her name because she was taken out of man.”,GNBDC
GEN,2,25,"The man and the woman were both naked, but they were not embarrassed.",GNBDC
GEN,3,2,"“We may eat the fruit of any tree in the garden,” the woman answered,",GNBDC
GEN,3,3,"“except the tree in the middle of it. God told us not to eat the fruit of that tree or even touch it; if we do, we will die.”",GNBDC
GEN,3,4,"The snake replied, “That's not true; you will not die.",GNBDC
GEN,3,5,"God said that, because he knows that when you eat it you will be like God",GNBDC
GEN,3,6,"The woman saw how beautiful the tree was and how good its fruit would be to eat, and she thought how wonderful it would be to become wise. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, and he also ate it.",GNBDC
GEN,3,7,"As soon as they had eaten it, they were given understanding and realized that they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and covered themselves.",GNBDC
GEN,3,8,That evening they heard the,GNBDC
GEN,3,9,But the,GNBDC
GEN,3,10,"He answered, “I heard you in the garden; I was afraid and hid from you, because I was naked.”",GNBDC
GEN,3,11,“Who told you that you were naked?” God asked. “Did you eat the fruit that I told you not to eat?”,GNBDC
GEN,3,12,"The man answered, “The woman you put here with me gave me the fruit, and I ate it.”",GNBDC
GEN,3,?,"She replied, “The snake tricked me into eating it.”",GNBDC
GEN,3,14,Then the,GNBDC
GEN,3,15,"I will make you and the woman hate each other; her offspring and yours will always be enemies. Her offspring will crush your head, and you will bite her offspring's",GNBDC
GEN,3,16,"And he said to the woman, “I will increase your trouble in pregnancy and your pain in giving birth. In spite of this, you will still have desire for your husband, yet you will be subject to him.”",GNBDC
GEN,3,18,"It will produce weeds and thorns, and you will have to eat wild plants.",GNBDC
GEN,3,19,"You will have to work hard and sweat to make the soil produce anything, until you go back to the soil from which you were formed. You were made from soil, and you will become soil again.”",GNBDC
GEN,3,20,Adam,GNBDC
GEN,3,21,And the,GNBDC
GEN,3,23,So the,GNBDC
GEN,3,24,Then at the east side of the garden he put living creatures,GNBDC
GEN,4,1,"Then Adam had intercourse with his wife, and she became pregnant. She bore a son and said, “By the",GNBDC
GEN,4,2,"Later she gave birth to another son, Abel. Abel became a shepherd, but Cain was a farmer.",GNBDC
GEN,4,3,"After some time, Cain brought some of his harvest and gave it as an offering to the",GNBDC
GEN,4,4,"Then Abel brought the first lamb born to one of his sheep, killed it, and gave the best parts of it as an offering. The",GNBDC
GEN,4,5,"but he rejected Cain and his offering. Cain became furious, and he scowled in anger.",GNBDC
GEN,4,6,Then the,GNBDC
GEN,4,7,"If you had done the right thing, you would be smiling;",GNBDC
GEN,4,9,The,GNBDC
GEN,4,?,"He answered, “I don't know. Am I supposed to take care of my brother?”",GNBDC
GEN,4,11,You are placed under a curse and can no longer farm the soil. It has soaked up your brother's blood as if it had opened its mouth to receive it when you killed him.,GNBDC
GEN,4,12,"If you try to grow crops, the soil will not produce anything; you will be a homeless wanderer on the earth.”",GNBDC
GEN,4,13,And Cain said to the,GNBDC
GEN,4,14,"You are driving me off the land and away from your presence. I will be a homeless wanderer on the earth, and anyone who finds me will kill me.”",GNBDC
GEN,4,15,But the,GNBDC
GEN,4,16,And Cain went away from the,GNBDC
GEN,4,17,Cain and his wife had a son and named him Enoch. Then Cain built a city and named it after his son.,GNBDC
